## ✨ Coding Standards
- Meaningful variable and method names  
- Modular and readable code structure  
- Edge-case handling  
- Optimal time and space complexity  

---

## 🚀 Learning Approach
- Start from easy problems and progress to medium and hard  
- Focus on understanding concepts instead of memorizing solutions  
- Practice multiple approaches when possible  

---

## Language Choice
Java is used for array-, string-, and search-based problems due to its readability and OOP support.  
C++ is preferred for pointer-based data structures such as linked lists, trees, and stacks for better memory control and performance.

This approach reflects real-world engineering practices where the most suitable language is chosen based on the problem.**
